/* waits for all child processes to finish and gathers the exit status
* of the shell's main process (identified by mini->pid):
* 1- Closes file descriptors.
* 2- Waits for child processes using waitpid.
* 3- Stores the status of the main child process.
*	After all child processes have finished and the loop ends,
*	the function evaluates how the main child process
*	(stored in save_status) terminated:
* WIFSIGNALED(save_status) checks if child was terminated by 
* a signal (SIGKILL, SIGINT).
* If the child was terminated by a signal, the exit status is calculated
* as 128 + WTERMSIG(save_status), where WTERMSIG extracts the signal number.
* WIFEXITED(save_status) checks if the child terminated normally via a 
* call to exit() or by returning from main(). If so, the exit status is 
* set to the exit code of the child, extracted using WEXITSTATUS(save_status).
* else : If the child didnâ€™t terminate in either of the above two conditions,
* it returns save_status as-is, which might handle other rare termination cases.
* 4- Checks if the child was terminated by a signal or exited normally 
* and returns the appropriate status.
* 	The function is crucial for correctly handling the termination of child
* 	processes and communicating their exit status to the parent shell 
* 	process, which affects how the shell responds after a command is executed.
